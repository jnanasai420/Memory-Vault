          <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
          <p>
            Snap a photo of your keepsake for example, a birthday card, child's
            art project or a note from a loved one. Upload it to your Memory
            Vault App and select the category you want it to be stored in.
            Simply add the date and person to store it under so you can easily
            browse memories.
